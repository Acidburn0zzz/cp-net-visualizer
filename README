This is Web-based software to visualize and edit conditional preference (CP) nets.

CP-nets are a formalism for modeling qualitative preferences under the ceteris paribus ("all other things being equal") semantics. They model preferences over multi-featured domains, and allow to express conditional preferences, e.g., "If I have a sports car I want a V8 engine, but if I have a small car, I want a hybrid engine."
